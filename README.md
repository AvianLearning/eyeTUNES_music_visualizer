# GeoQuiz educational web app and game

Art For Everyone.

Our aim is to create an online space that allows inclusive access to the creation of art and music through your computerâ€™s keyboard and/or mouse. 

Users should not require any musical or artistic background in order to get audio or visual feedback while they interact with the app. It should be a playful, exploratory experience


## MVP

The user should be able to:

- Play a piano-type instrument that generates notes with computer keyboard
- Create a visualisation - colours/shapes change in response to audio created
- Save, delete and view a collection of songs


## Example Extensions

- Song tempo slider
- Enable user to customise colors and keyboard
- Be able to use the keyboard on screen
- Select different animations and instruments to play


## API, Libraries, Resources
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser.
- [anime,js](https://animejs.com/) - Lightweight JavaScript animation library
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
