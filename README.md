# eyeTunes - Music visualizer

Art For Everyone.

Our aim is to create an online space that allows inclusive access to the creation of art and music through your computerâ€™s keyboard and/or mouse. 

Users should not require any musical or artistic background in order to get audio or visual feedback while they interact with the app. It should be a playful, exploratory experience

## MVP

The user should be able to:

- Play a piano-type instrument that generates notes with computer keyboard
- Create a visualisation - colours/shapes change in response to audio created
- Save, delete and view a collection of songs


## Example Extensions

- Song tempo slider
- Enable user to customise colors and keyboard
- Be able to use the keyboard on screen
- Select different animations and instruments to play
